## Types of Python Frameworks
### 1. Full-Stack Framework

Such frameworks are a one-stop solution for all developer requirements. Form generators, form validation, and template layouts are usually available with a typical full-stack framework.

### 2. Microframework

These are lightweight frameworks that don’t offer additional functionalities and features, such as database abstraction layer, form validation, and specific tools and libraries. Developers using a microframework need to add a lot of code and additional requirements manually.

### 3. Asynchronous Framework

Gaining popularity recently, any asynchronous framework is a microframework that allows for handling a large set of concurrent connections. Typically, an asynchronous framework built for Python uses the programming language’s asyncio library.
